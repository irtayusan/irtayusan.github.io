In the other corner, there's the Liteboxer, a gamified, party-pleasing boxing machine. Which one comes out on top?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both of these at-home boxing options are fantastic investments, no doubt about it. But depending on your workout preferences, you might find that the FightCamp is a better option for you than the Liteboxer, or vice versa.</p><p>I've personally tested out both the <a href=#>FightCamp</a> and the <a href=#>Liteboxer</a>, so feel free to check out those full reviews if you want to learn more about either system. But this is going to be more of a comparison of each at-home boxing system's pros and cons, and a look at how to decide which one is right for you and your workout needs.</p><h2 id=price-they-re-both-expensive>Price: They're Both Expensive</h2><p>Although the FightCamp system is more affordable than the Liteboxer system, it's still an expensive investment. When it comes to the monthly subscription, however, Liteboxer is about $10 cheaper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a <a href=#>FightCamp Personal</a> package, you spend $1,219 to get a pair of boxing gloves, quick wraps, smart punch trackers, a free-standing punching bag, and a bag ring to keep it in place while you work out. The company gives you the option to either pay for this upfront or in monthly payments with Affirm. Then, the required monthly membership fee to keep up with in-app workouts is $39 per month.</p><p>If you want the heavy rubber mats, you'll need to spring for the <a href=#>FightCamp Tribe</a> package, which costs $1,395. In addition to the adjustable 8-feet by 4-feet heavy mat, the Tribe package also comes with an extra pair of boxing gloves and quick wraps, as well as a pair of kid's boxing gloves.</p><p><a href=#>Liteboxer's Starter package</a>&nbsp;costs you $1,695, though as with FightCamp's system above, you can finance it out through Affirm into monthly payments. You get the boxing machine, of course, as well as a pair of gloves, boxing wraps, and a free month's worth of Liteboxer's monthly membership. After that free month, you'll have to pay $29.99 per month to stay up to date with new workouts and punch tracks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liteboxer also has a new <a href=#>Wall Mount Starter</a> package that costs $1,495 and doesn't take up as much space in your home. However, I haven't personally tried this package out, so for the purposes of this article, I'll be comparing the FightCamp Personal and the Liteboxer Traditional Starter.</p><h2 id=setup-amp-space-how-much-room-do-you-have>Setup & Space: How Much Room Do You Have?</h2><p>With any bulky at-home fitness equipment, it's important to consider how much space you have in your home to work with. Make sure you measure the area you think you'd put your equipment in to avoid any snags after it's already been shipped to your home. And once you have your system, how easy is it to set up?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b31b624a.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>FightCamp's system can fit in any space that's at least two feet by two feet. Of course, you'll want to leave additional room for yourself, so you can throw punches, launch kicks, and do squats and other core workouts away from the punching bag.</p><p>And it's super easy to set up your FightCamp, even by yourself. There are two main components of the punching bag that are shipped to you, the hollow base and the bag.</p><p>Then, you choose whether to fill the base with water or purchase <a href=#>sand</a> to fill it with (I'd recommend the sand!). Once you choose water or sand, you fill the base up, fix the punching bag on top, and secure it with the attached straps.</p><p>If you ever need to move your FightCamp, all you have to do is reach up to the top of the base, pull it down towards you, and roll it where you need it to go using the weighted base. This feature makes FightCamp's system great for people who want a punching bag for at-home workouts but live in a small home with not a lot of extra space. You can tuck it into a closet or a corner when you're not using it and roll it out when you need it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/5034de88.jpg> Sarah Chaney / Review Geek<p>When Liteboxer's system is fully assembled, it has a footprint of roughly three feet by five feet (more specifically, 37.6-inches by 55.5-inches). And it's pretty heavy, so you'll want to be sure it's in the right spot before you go through the hassle of setting it up.</p><p>Also, just like FightCamp has you do exercises away from the punching bag, Liteboxer trainers sometimes have you do exercises off the platform. So in addition to needing more space for the machine itself, you'll also need to make sure you have enough space to do off-machine exercises.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, I didn't have to set up my Liteboxer. And I say luckily because it looked difficult. I had two bulky men deliver and set up my Liteboxer and it took them about an hour or two even though they set these up all the time. The Liteboxer is heavy and sturdy, which is awesome when you're working out, but not so awesome when you have to carry it into your home and set it up.</p><p>For people in average-sized homes or large homes, space probably won't be much of a concern. But if your place has a smaller square footage, you'll probably want to go with the FightCamp. Unless everything else about the Liteboxer sounds more appealing and you want to dedicate an area in your small home to it, FightCamp will be easier to store and use in a smaller home.</p><p>Since I didn't set up the Liteboxer myself, I don't know exactly how hard it would be for the average person. But I heard a lot of huffing and puffing while it was being set up, so I imagine it's a workout in and of itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The FightCamp, on the other hand, is super simple to set up if you use sand. Don't be like me, and set your FightCamp up on the second story of your house, refuse to buy sand, and spend an hour or two filling the base up with water from multiple trips between the sink and the base. It wasn't a fun time, but you can learn from my experience and just buy the dang sand if you get a FightCamp.</p><p>FightCamp wins here because it requires less space to work out on effectively and it's much, much easier to set up.</p><h2 id=experience-how-did-it-feel-to-workout-on-each-machine>Experience: How Did It Feel to Workout on Each Machine?</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>It's nice if a workout machine looks decent in your home because, let's be honest, they rarely do, but most important is how that machine feels when you're working out on it. If it looks great, but can't handle your powerful workouts, you're not going to use it as often as you should to get your money's worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Purely speaking on which machine could handle punches better, the FightCamp felt sturdier than the Liteboxer, even with just water inside the base. Sand makes the FightCamp's base heavier, and a combination of sand and water makes it even heavier.</p><p>FightCamp gives you a traditional boxing experience, with a punching bag that you can wail on without feeling like it's going to topple over. The gloves are okay, but if you have some extra money, I'd recommend getting a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">higher-quality pair of gloves</a>. And the workout videos and coaches do a great job teaching you the fundamentals of boxing and kickboxing.</p><p>Liteboxer's machine was extremely fun to workout on, and I always got an excellent workout whenever I loaded up a punch track or a workout video. But for people who throw stronger punches than I do, I think the Liteboxer might be a bit lackluster when it comes to sturdiness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>The Liteboxer comes with a setting called punch sensitivity; you can turn this on if you feel the Liteboxer machine isn't recognizing your punches because you're not punching hard enough. For reference, I had to turn this on if I didn't want to throw my whole self into every punch just for the machine to register it. With that said, my weak little punches were still enough to make the punching board wobble a little bit, especially when I went a little harder and averaged a punch sensitivity of three out of five.</p><p>If someone stronger averaged a five punch sensitivity, I'm not sure how well the Liteboxer would be able to handle that on a regular basis. It's probably built to withstand that kind of strong punching, but not without significant bounceback from the punching board, which makes it feel weaker than it might actually be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liteboxer does have that new <a href=#>Wall Mount option</a> I mentioned earlier, which might fare better with strong punches since the punching board isn't being suspended by a pole. But I haven't personally tried it out yet, so I can't say for sure.</p><p>FightCamp wins yet again here because it felt more like the boxing experience I was after. Putting my weight into a real punching bag was more satisfying than hitting Liteboxer's punching board.</p><h2 id=the-app-experience-on-par-with-what-you-d-expect>The App Experience: On Par With What You'd Expect</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Both apps function well and are easy to use and navigate around. For a long while, Liteboxer had a big advantage over FightCamp because there was a Liteboxer app for both <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a> and <a href=#>iOS</a>, whereas FightCamp only had an app for <a href=#>iOS</a>&nbsp;users.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, however, FightCamp has an app for <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a> users. It's still in early access, so there may be some minor issues that need fixing before the app is ready for a full release, but it's there now. I've tried it out and haven't run into any differences or bugs in the Android app versus the iOS app.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><h2 id=the-workouts-how-much-variety-is-there>The Workouts: How Much Variety Is There?</h2><p>FightCamp offers Curated Paths, which are great for learning the essentials and fundamentals for both boxing and kickboxing if you want to make either your go-to exercise choice. Paths are 10 days long, with rest days built-in, and include a collection of tutorials, workouts, and drills chosen by FightCamp's coaches. In addition to Paths, there are also Drills and workouts that focus on Boxing, Kickboxing, or Core.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can customize your experience with FightCamp and create your own workout "stack," with your main workout sandwiched between a warmup and some core exercises. Main workouts vary from around 15 minutes to 40 minutes. But if you add a warmup or core exercise to your main workout, you could easily strive to exercise for&nbsp;over an hour.</p><p>One of my favorite features of FightCamp's app that amps up your workouts is that you can choose which music style you want to listen to. You can choose the default FightCamp Radio or try out 2000's Pop, Top 40, Rock, or one of the other stations. And no matter which one you choose, the songs that are played will match up well with the beat of the workout.</p><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Liteboxer has Trainer classes that vary in length from around seven minutes to 30 minutes and are led by a variety of Liteboxer's skilled trainers. Then, there are Build + Restore classes that focus more on restorative exercises that strengthen and tone your body.</p><p>And although Liteboxer's classes are pretty awesome, my favorite way to work out was with Punch Tracks. Liteboxer has a library full of songs from different genres to choose from for your Punch Track workout. You can choose however many songs you want to, depending on how intense you want your workout to be that day. Then, each Punch Track comes with three difficulties: easy, medium, or hard.</p><p>Punch tracks make it super easy to hop on for one quick song when you're not feeling incredibly motivated to work out. Then, once you're moving, it's easier to add a few more songs to your workout queue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <span class=txt>Close</span><p>Looking at the variety of ways to exercise as well as the personality and skill of the coaches, Liteboxer and FightCamp are evenly matched here.</p><h2 id=gamification-watch-your-motivation-to-work-out-skyrocket>Gamification: Watch Your Motivation to Work Out Skyrocket</h2><p>Because both the FightCamp and Liteboxer involve smart workout tracking tech, it's important to discuss how motivated I was to workout on each system based on that tracking tech.</p><p>With the Liteboxer, my motivation to work out was a lot higher than with FightCamp purely because of the Punch Tracks. Being able to pair my phone easily for just a single three or four minute song (which would still make me sweat thoroughly) made working out seem less intimidating. And then, once I finished punching my way through a song, I found myself wanting to try out another song or two because it's just a fun way to work out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although there is educational content on Liteboxer's platform, I didn't learn a whole lot about boxing fundamentals on this machine. Because Punch Tracks were easy to understand, I gravitated toward them a lot more as my workout of choice. And being able to see how many punches I threw, what my average punch sensitivity was, and my overall score after each song was so much fun. I ended up competing with myself a lot and pushing myself to do more each time.</p><p>Whereas Liteboxer's tracking tech is built into the system itself, FightCamp's tracking tech is in the form of two small punch trackers that fit inside your wrist wraps and boxing gloves.&nbsp;FightCamp's punch trackers show you how many punches you threw and how close you were to the punch goal, your average max speed, and how many rounds you completed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>FightCamp's smart trackers definitely helped me push myself to get more out of each workout. When you're in the middle of a workout, you can see your punches adding up real-time on the screen. Each round has a punch goal that you're working towards, so if I saw that I had 30 seconds left in a round, I would pick up my pace and try to punch it out and meet or exceed that punch goal before the round ended.</p><p>Because FightCamp doesn't have anything like Liteboxer's Punch Tracks, I was forced to commit to at least a 15 minute workout, which helped me get a more thorough full-body workout as well as learn more from the coaches instead of just punching to music. Although I might've been more motivated to work out on the Liteboxer, I felt like I got a better workout with the FightCamp.</p><p>From the gamification aspect, Liteboxer wins over FightCamp. It was a lot more fun to work out on the Liteboxer and then see my score after every punch track.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=conclusion-which-at-home-boxing-system-is-right-for-you>Conclusion: Which At-Home Boxing System Is Right For You?</h2><p>Both the FightCamp and the Liteboxer are excellent boxing systems, and as long as you have the space and money for either, you're going to be one happy, sweaty person after your workouts. Ultimately, your decision will come down to what you want out of your workouts and how you best like to work out .</p><p>Personally, I'd recommend the FightCamp over the Liteboxer. For anyone who already loves boxing or kickboxing, or anyone who's just interested in experimenting with those workout genres, FightCamp provides a more authentic experience.</p><p>For beginners, you can&nbsp;learn the fundamentals to perfect your stance, form, and just grow as a boxer or kickboxer. And the punch trackers are accurate and highly motivating, making you throw more punches than you did last time or more than the round goal at hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoaW5jaoZwssign62bkaK9bsLSZqOirJWXvLmx0WauoaGTnXqiwIyhpqadXZe8ubXNoGSssaOpsq551qKlrGWknbJussign61n</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2ffightcamp-vs-liteboxer-which-at-home-boxing-system-wins-the-fight.html&title=FightCamp%20vs%20Liteboxer%3a%20Which%20At-Home%20Boxing%20System%20Wins%20the%20Fight%3f" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffightcamp-vs-liteboxer-which-at-home-boxing-system-wins-the-fight.html&description=FightCamp%20vs%20Liteboxer%3a%20Which%20At-Home%20Boxing%20System%20Wins%20the%20Fight%3f" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffightcamp-vs-liteboxer-which-at-home-boxing-system-wins-the-fight.html&title=FightCamp%20vs%20Liteboxer%3a%20Which%20At-Home%20Boxing%20System%20Wins%20the%20Fight%3f" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2ffightcamp-vs-liteboxer-which-at-home-boxing-system-wins-the-fight.html&title=FightCamp%20vs%20Liteboxer%3a%20Which%20At-Home%20Boxing%20System%20Wins%20the%20Fight%3f" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2ffightcamp-vs-liteboxer-which-at-home-boxing-system-wins-the-fight.html&text=FightCamp%20vs%20Liteboxer%3a%20Which%20At-Home%20Boxing%20System%20Wins%20the%20Fight%3f" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2ffightcamp-vs-liteboxer-which-at-home-boxing-system-wins-the-fight.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-06-09</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./gabe-the-dog-biography-6-interesting-facts-you-need-to-know.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Gabe The Dog Biography 6 Interesting Facts You Need To Know</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./which-workaholics-star-has-the-highest-net-worth-adam-devine-blake-anderson-or-anders-holm-html.html><h3>Adam DeVine, Blake Anderson, or Anders Holm? >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
