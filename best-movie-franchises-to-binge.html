After all, there’s nothing better to take your mind off the news or uncertainty than disappearing into a great story. TV binges can do that too, but there are only so many episodes of <a href=#><strong>The Office</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Shameless</strong></a> to watch on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. If you want a real project, how about a full-on movie marathon?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Franchises have been king for decades, but it’s rare to find a movie franchise to binge with a high average of good-to-great movies. Yes <a href=#><strong>Jaws</strong></a> is a masterpiece, but nobody wants to watch <strong>Jaws: The Revenge</strong>.</p><p>But if you’re stumped on which are the best movie series to binge, we’ve got you covered. We’ve put together a hefty list of movie franchises to binge that will get you the most bang for your buck—the most amount of good/great movies, and the least amount of stinkers. They also vary wildly in tone, so whether you’re in the mood for a rollicking adventure, a thematically rich trilogy, or a full-on gore fest, there’s really something for everyone here.</p><p>Editor's Note: This article has been updated with new franchise additions as of January 20, 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why the 'Saw' Franchise Needs to Fix Its Villain Problem</a></span></p><h2 id=the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-ndash-extended-editions>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy – Extended Editions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lord-of-the-rings.jpg><p>If you’re really looking for a long marathon, I cannot recommend the <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> trilogy extended editions enough. <strong>Return of the King</strong> is a full 51 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, so yeah, this is a commitment. And while the theatrical cuts of these films may technically be a more concise/better way of telling the story, I find that the extended editions are almost like a “living novel” experience. They’re just so dense, but also really slow down and take their time with the characters—and unlike <strong>The Hobbit</strong> trilogy, these characters are actually compelling. Watching all three of these in a row is like disappearing into Middle-earth for an entire day. What could be better than that at this particular point in time? – Adam Chitwood</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mission-impossible>Mission: Impossible</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol.jpeg><p>Pound for pound, <a href=#><strong>Mission: Impossible</strong></a> is the best franchise running right now. The level of quality on these films is astounding, but it’s the dynamism from film-to-film that really makes them special. The <strong>Bond</strong> and <strong>Bourne</strong> movies kind of blur together a bit, but each Mission: Impossible movie is distinct, with filmmakers bringing their own flavor to the spy series. The first film is a sultry <strong>Brian De Palma</strong> thriller through-and-through; <strong>M:I 2</strong> is over-the-top <strong>John Woo</strong> action (and is the only “bad” movie in the franchise despite certain redeeming qualities); <strong>Mission: Impossible 3</strong> is a romantic and deeply personal affair thanks to <strong>J.J. Abrams</strong> (even if it’s a little similar to Alias); <strong>Brad Bird</strong>’s <strong>Ghost Protocol</strong> is nearly cartoonish in the best possible way; <strong>Christopher McQuarrie</strong>’s<strong> Rogue Nation</strong> is a suave 1940s throwback and the director's <strong>Fallout</strong> is an epic, <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>-y actioner full of stunning set pieces. And through it all, <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> just simply never quits being the coolest. Why not catch up before <a href=#><strong>Mission: Impossible 7 </strong>'s release later this year</a>? – Adam Chitwood</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friday-the-13th>Friday the 13th</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/friday-the-13th-jason-lives.jpg><p>Jason Vorhees is the greatest physical comedian since the silent film era, and you need look no further than his very first appearance in <strong>Friday the 13th Part 2</strong> to verify this fact. He wears a goofy burlap sack on his head with a single eyehole, and at one point in the film tries to ambush someone hiding beneath a bed by standing on a chair and ends up crashing through the chair like an absolute rube instead. Then he gets kicked in the balls with an audible “OOF!” It’s wonderful. The infamous slasher series gradually realizes that Jason is way more funny than scary, most noticeably in <strong>Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives</strong>, a movie in which Jason folds a man in half like a wardrobe bag and crashes a Winnebego on the highway. <strong>Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan</strong> has an all-time cinema moment involving Jason dropkicking a boombox across Times Square. He then goes to space and fights Freddy Kruger in that order (to clarify, Freddy Kruger is not in space). Even the 2009 remake is pretty enjoyable, turning Jason into a backwoods Solid Snake rigging Crystal Lake with booby traps to protect his weed farm from <strong>Jared Padalecki</strong>. That’s not a joke. It’s one of the most consistently enjoyable horror series just in terms of iconic slasher movie moments, and the films in which they lean into playing Jason purely for comedy are when it truly shines. – Tom Reimann</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=harry-potter>Harry Potter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Image-of-Daniel-Radcliff-in-Harry-Potter.jpg><p>A personal favorite of mine, you’re either really into <strong>Harry Potter</strong> or it’s just not for you.

I had fun with the movies and enjoyed the change in tone and aesthetic from film-to-film, but my full-on Harry Potter obsession didn’t come until after I had acquainted myself with <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong>’s masterful book series. These films are so lovingly crafted and true to the spirit of Rowling’s books, but also take inspired swings. They’re some of the best examples of book-to-film adaptations in history: they don’t do a disservice to Harry Potter, but they’re also not afraid to make changes that deepen the characters. This is partly due to the fact that four very different directors helmed this series, each with his own point of view on what this story of good vs. evil, of found family, and of the remarkable power of love meant to them. But also just as a piece of entertainment, the variety of flavor you find from film to film, and the skill with which this one long story plays out in seven different parts, makes it highly watchable in a marathon setting. – Adam Chitwood</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=indiana-jones>Indiana Jones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-harrison-ford.jpg><p>Top to bottom, full stop, the <a href=#><strong>Indiana Jones</strong></a> movies are the grandest adventure you can go on without ever leaving your home. <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong> took all the best aspects of swashbuckling 1930s and 40s serials, added his own supernatural knack for spectacle, and topped it all off with the most charismatic mother effer on the planet, <strong>Harrison Ford</strong>, as the daring archeologist battling Nazis, death cults, and the wrath of God himself to obtain rare artifacts. The general pulse-pounding nature of these movies will rocket you through, but there’s also more variety between them than immediately meets the eye. <strong>Raiders of the Lost Ark</strong> has been proven by science* to be the perfect action movie—to paraphrase Indy himself, that truck chase belongs in a museum—where the real treasure is Douglas Slocombe’s cinematography. <strong>Temple of Doom</strong> gets way darker, literally inventing the PG-13 rating with its bloody, below-ground spookiness. <strong>The Last Crusade</strong> is basically the franchise’s Avengers-level event film, quadrupling down on every bombastic quirk of the series while doubling the Joneses with the addition of Sean Connery’s Henry Jones Sr. And that’s it! That’s all the Indiana Jones movies!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I’m kidding. <strong>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</strong> is, rightfully, regarded as the unnecessary weak spot in an otherwise flawless series.

But they were heavily stylized, fantastical, and otherworldly. <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>, coming off his indie breakthrough <strong>Memento </strong>and his studio entrypoint <strong>Insomnia</strong>, took the world of the caped crusader and grounded it into something that felt like our actual, visceral, tangible world. <strong>Christian Bale</strong> growling, <strong>Heath Ledger </strong>asking about these scars, <strong>Tom Hardy</strong>’s whole thing -- these have all become so ubiquitous in our culture they border on solely existing as things to be parodied. But returning to the sources, you’ll be reminded of these films’ sheer power, scope, and filmmaking courage. After the moral complications of Begins comes the powerhouse of <a href=#><strong>The Dark Knight</strong></a>, Nolan’s version of <strong>Heat </strong>rife with gritty photography and one helluva performance from Ledger. And after the grittily narrow focus of Dark Knight comes the bigger, broader, sloppier, and arguably funner <strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>. Hardy is instantly iconic, yes, but my biggest props go to <strong>Anne Hathaway</strong>, who gives Catwoman a vital sense of humor and fun that powers the rest of the action-packed flick. Plus -- the scene with <strong>Michael Caine </strong>making a big decision will always make me cry. You either die a hero, or live long enough to forget how good the Dark Knight trilogy is. Make your choice wisely. - Greg Smith</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paranormal-activity>Paranormal Activity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Paranormal-Activity-4.jpg><p><strong>Paranormal Activity</strong> is one of the best horror film franchises ever created - just make sure you stop watching after the third film. <strong>Oren Peli</strong>’s 2009 original is an incredible feat of creativity, economical filmmaking and character development. One might think the late-night recording sessions would grow old fast but the pairing of smart scares with the growing attachment to the main characters, Katie and Micah (<strong>Katie Featherston</strong> and <strong>Micah Sloat</strong>), not only makes that first film so much more than a spooky shtick, but it also successfully builds a foundation that would help support two phenomenal sequels. When <strong>Paranormal Activity 2 </strong>arrived in 2010, my burning question was, how could they possibly pull this off again without making it feel like more of the same? Yes, Peli and the growing team of Paranormal filmmakers do add some new visual tricks, but a big reason why Paranormal Activity 2 is just as successful as the first is because it appears character and story came first. Round two put the spotlight on Katie’s sister, Kristi (<strong>Sprague Grayden</strong>), and then with the third film, the team made a downright genius decision - use what they achieved in the first two films to bolster a third. <strong>Paranormal Activity 3</strong> goes back to 1988 and focuses on a young Katie and Kristi. Not only does that choice continue to make the duo extremely well-developed anchors for the trilogy, but it also opens the door wide open to new techniques for the found footage format, and directors <strong>Henry Joost</strong> and <strong>Ariel Schulman</strong> really make the most of that opportunity. The first three films make for a brilliant trilogy before the main series essentially crashes and burns, but if you’re looking for a little bonus viewing after Paranormal Activity 1, 2 and 3, the spin-off film, <strong>Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones</strong>,<strong> </strong>deserves way more credit that it gets. There's also <strong>Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension</strong>, <strong>Paranormal Activity: Next of Kin</strong>, and a Japanese sidequal <strong>Paranormal Activity 2: Tokyo Night</strong> - Perri Nemiroff</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-pirates-of-the-caribbean-trilogy>The Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl-johnny-depp-social.jpg><p>Okay yes, technically there are five <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> films. You can watch <strong>On Stranger Tides</strong> and <strong>Dead Men Tell No Tales</strong> if you want to, but I’m here to sing the praises of director <strong>Gore Verbinski</strong>’s delightfully insane original trilogy. The first film, <strong>The Curse of the Black Pearl</strong>, is one of the best pieces of blockbuster entertainment made in the 21st century. It’s thrilling and funny and adventurous, but also deeply inspired—<strong>Johnny Depp</strong>’s performance as Jack Sparrow is instantly iconic, and Verbinski clearly knew it the way he tees up Depp to go wild. But the following two sequels <strong>Dead Man’s Chest</strong> and <strong>At World’s End</strong>—which Verbinski shot back-to-back in a herculean feat of filmmaking—<a href=#>are good, actually</a>. They take huge swings with an epic, serialized adventure that plays out across the span of two movies, all the while digging deeper into the seedy pirate underworld with a menagerie of colorful characters. Watched in sequence, the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films tell an epically adventurous story of thievery and love in the time of pirates. – Adam Chitwood</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-lego-movies>The LEGO Movies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/the-lego-movie-3-600x251.jpg><p>Are you in need of a franchise that captures the whimsy of your childhood while also making elevated jokes that speak to your experiences as an adult?

But watching all nine movies, from 2004’s <strong>Saw</strong> to 2021's <strong>Spiral</strong>, is uniquely fascinating in the way a simple idea straight-up exploded outward like an atom bomb. The first Saw film—directed by <strong>James Wan</strong> and written by <strong>Leigh Whannell</strong>, who also stars—deserves its place next to genre’s greatest hits. It’s a tight, tense thrill-ride filled with killer scares that manages to keep the bulk of its action to a single room while still introducing a new horror icon, the Jigsaw Killer (<strong>Tobin Bell</strong>), a gravel-voiced mastermind who hooks victims up to complex traps to teach them the value of life. Saw 2 took that ingenious nugget and expanded on it, with bigger traps, wilder twists, and much, much more gore. Each ensuing movie did the same, until the simplicity of Saw transformed into its own complex maze of copy-cat killers, surprise flashbacks, twists-within-twists, and death-traps that pushed right past logic and reasoning. (A chain that pulls you toward an entire wall of buzzsaws is a long way from a rusty saw in a plastic bag at the back of a toilet.) Does that mean all the Saw movies are “good”? Absolutely not, I’m not here for false advertising. But I personally chose the Saw franchise as my first quarantine rewatch, and it has been one hell of a good time. - Vinnie Mancuso</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=back-to-the-future>Back to the Future</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/back-to-the-future-christopher-lloyd-michael-j-fox-social.jpg><p>The OG “we’re gonna shoot the sequels back-to-back,” <strong>Back to the Future</strong> is one of the most iconic franchises of all time, and I think its sequels still don’t get the respect they deserve. <strong>Robert Zemeckis</strong>’ original film is a masterpiece of sci-fi filmmaking, yes. Zemeckis translates the idea of “what if you went to high school with your parents?” into a hilarious, inventive time travel romp, and that movie still holds up as a stone cold classic. But the sequels are fun too! <strong>Back to the Future Part II</strong> is not only a wish-fulfillment idealized version of what the future might look like, but also a clever twist on the “butterfly effect” idea, showing how Marty McFly’s (<a href=#><strong>Michael J. Fox</strong></a>) actions snowball to create a hellish future in which Donald Trump Biff Tannen is in power. And while <strong>Part III</strong> is maybe a bit of a step down in quality, it’s still tremendously fun to watch Marty and Doc fumble around the Wild West while Zemeckis continues to play with storytelling echoes from the first two movies. – Adam Chitwood</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-original-robocop-trilogy>The Original RoboCop Trilogy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/robocop-image.jpeg><p>If you haven’t seen the original <strong>RoboCop </strong>by now, my word. It is, of course, a classic genre-bending, muckraking, cyberpunk masterpiece brimming with ultraviolence, bleak comedy, and a surprising amount of emotional sensitivity about its titular robot cop whose humanity is hiding somewhere in his circuitry. But <strong>Paul Verhoeven</strong>’s classic ain’t the only picture worth watching in the original trilogy. <strong>RoboCop 2</strong>, from director <strong>Irvin Kershner </strong>(who knows his way around a middle chapter of a trilogy), contains one of the funniest and most inspired ideas in the RoboCop mythology -- while I don’t want to spoil it too much, it involves the rewiring of Mister Cop, and a whole bunch of vulgar kids. It also contains a very prescient narrative involving horrible, cult of personality leaders and my hometown of Detroit literally declaring bankruptcy (something my hometown literally did 23 years later). And while most will tell you <strong>RoboCop 3 </strong>is not worth your time, I can’t help but have a soft spot. Yes there’s a new man under the robotic cop suit, yes it’s now PG-13, and yes director <strong>Fred Dekker</strong> perhaps unnecessarily broadens his purview out to a more fantastical post-apocalyptic zone. But boy howdy, do I love the production design, mythologically high stakes, chintzy early ‘90s visual effects, and bonkers-ass performance from <strong>Rip Torn</strong> on this sucker. Each film feels slightly different from the last, but each film will provide intense thrills, imagination, and sick belly laughs, making the entire RoboCop trilogy worth your time and then some.

But what gets lost a lot in the conversation is the fact that Star Wars is great, has always been great, and remains great even when the discourse gets as coarse and rough as all that dang sand. Twelve films separated trilogies, an origin story, a spinoff, and an animated adventure—heck, 15 if you can track down the Holiday Special and two Ewok movies—all revolving around the galactic struggle between a ruthless ruling class and the rebels who defy them. Within that epic framework dreamed up by <strong>George Lucas</strong>, some of the most enduring icons of the genre were created. The ultimate hero’s journey in Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). The blueprint for a charming scoundrel in Han Solo (<strong>Harrison Ford</strong>).

Well, if you’re earnestly steamed about it, I suppose you can enact some kind of complicated plan of revenge against me. That sickly, primal, all-too-human impulse of “revenge” is at the center of <strong>Park Chan-wook</strong>’s “trilogy,” three works that reach nearly operatic heights of melodrama, visually render some extreme imagery in inventive ways, and cut to the core of humanity with relentless watchability. The first film, <strong>Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance</strong>, tells the bitter tale of a father obsessed in finding the deaf-mute man who accidentally killed his daughter. The second and most well-known, <strong>Oldboy</strong>, takes its cue from a manga to tell the labyrinthian tale of a man imprisoned for 15 years, and then released inexplicably to try and find who captured him (avoid the <strong>Spike Lee </strong>remake at all costs). And the final film, <strong>Lady Vengeance</strong>, tells what’s likely the most morally ambiguous, complicated tale of a woman wrongfully imprisoned for the crimes of a child-killer, and how she plans on finding the real criminal now that she’s released (make sure you watch the “Fade to Black and White” version, in which Park subtly desaturates the colors to match his characters’ descent into desperation). All three films make for fascinating, self-contained watches, and all three films will make you need a shower after, for both different and similar reasons. - Greg Smith</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scream>Scream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sid.jpeg><p>There are many horror franchises which stand the test of time and the <a href=#><strong>Scream</strong></a><strong> </strong>franchise absolutely ranks high among them. No matter which of the four Scream movies you choose to watch, each serves up healthy portions of gory scares with enjoyably overt meta-commentary on the horror genre. The franchise begins with 1996’s Scream, which takes the shape of a traditional slasher flick as we follow good girl Sidney Prescott (<strong>Neve Campbell</strong>) and her group of friends (played by <strong>Rose McGowan</strong>, <strong>Skeet Ulrich</strong>, <strong>Jamie Kennedy</strong>, and <strong>Matthew Lillard</strong>) as they try to evade the masked killer known as Ghostface terrorizing their small town. While every installment takes on this basic set-up, with Sidney and her friends or close allies stalked by Ghostface, the true thrill of each movie is watching as different culprits put on the mask and try to make Sidney their prey. Sidney is, of course, a seasoned badass molded in the form of final girls like <strong>Halloween</strong>’s Laurie Strode and she takes no prisoners. As the world of Scream expands with every successive movie, the in-universe jokes — like the development of the fictional Stab franchise which adapts the horrors Sidney endures into meta-horror movies — make the meta-commentary more apparent and make for a more rewarding viewing experience. - Allie Gemmill</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jurassic-park>Jurassic Park</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/jurassic-park.jpeg><p>Considering <strong>Jurassic Park</strong> is my favorite movie of all-time, this franchise was an obvious pick for me.

Watch them all in a row and see how much long-range story planning you can spot. – Adam Chitwood</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kr6a%2F02akqK6ZmnqnvsCnmqGho5rAbsDOZpmippeafA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fbest-movie-franchises-to-binge.html&title=The%20Best%20Movie%20Franchises%20to%20Binge" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-movie-franchises-to-binge.html&description=The%20Best%20Movie%20Franchises%20to%20Binge" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-movie-franchises-to-binge.html&title=The%20Best%20Movie%20Franchises%20to%20Binge" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fbest-movie-franchises-to-binge.html&title=The%20Best%20Movie%20Franchises%20to%20Binge" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fbest-movie-franchises-to-binge.html&text=The%20Best%20Movie%20Franchises%20to%20Binge" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fbest-movie-franchises-to-binge.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Reinaldo Massengill</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-09-18</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./the-eagles-announce-final-tour-the-long-goodbye.html><h3>&lt;&lt; The Eagles Announce Final Tour The Long Goodbye</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./nicolangelo-saint-james-haner.html><h3>Synyster Gates Children Have Unique Names >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
